Separate the generated code in two separated files. 

One with non executable code, just the architeture generated from sysADL,
with types, generic and specific classes for ports, components, conectors.
Futhermore this file will have bindings, bindings configuration, executables and constraints.

And the second file will be the simulation file, with the funcion simulate and the main funcion.
